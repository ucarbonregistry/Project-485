The project activity is composed of two sugar cane plants, located in the cities of Quirinópolis (São Francisco Plant) and
Cachoeira Dourada (Rio Dourado Plant), both in the state of Goiás, Brazil.

The purpose of the activity is to generate electricity using renewable biomass (sugarcane bagasse,
which is the residue from the juice extraction process for the production of ethanol and sugar), and,
thus, reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil fuel in grid-based electricity.
It is a grid-connected biomass cogeneration power plant with a high-pressure steam-turbine
configuration. The high-pressure boilers are fired by bagasse to generate steam which in turn is fed
to the steam turbine to generate power. The power co-generation units generate biomass-based power
for captive consumption of the sugar plant and the sale of surplus power to the Brazilian electricity
grid.

The UCR Project activity is the construction and operation of power plants/units that use renewable
energy sources and supplies renewable electricity to the grid. The UCR project activity is thus the
displacement of electricity that would be provided to the grid by more-GHG-intensive means and
provides long-term benefits to the mitigation of climate change. The UCR project activity qualifies
under the environmental additional positive list of pre-approved project types under the UCR carbon
incentive model for issuance of voluntary carbon credits.

The activity currently produces more than 650,000 MWh of electrical energy per year and, of this
total, and 430,000 MWh are injected into the Brazilian electrical system, enough to supply a city of
approximately 200,000 inhabitants, and thereby contributes to climate change mitigation efforts. 
_____________
The municipality of Quirinópolis was chosen to host the group's new industrial unit due to its
privileged location in the southwest of the state. To build the new plant, the first step was to prepare
the land at Fazenda São Francisco II. Then, in 2005 the first buildings appeared and, in parallel, a
broad process of selection and training of personnel to join the team of employees at Usina São
Francisco (USF) began. In 2006, the industrial unit began operations, focusing on the production of
sugar, ethanol and electricity.

In 2007, the company decided to build the second diffuser at USF, expanding its production capacity.
With the new structure, the first step was taken towards becoming one of the largest bioenergy
producers in the state of Goiás.

Rio Dourado Plant:
To expand its operations in the state of Goiás, the USJ Group began, in 2009, the construction of the
second industrial unit, the Rio Dourado Plant (URD). The location chosen for the new headquarters
was the municipality of Cachoeira Doura, as it is close to the USF, which would allow the
optimization of agricultural and industrial operations.

In July 2013, the Rio Dourado Plant (URD) was inaugurated, with the most modern industrial
structure in the country at the time. The unit is dedicated to the production of ethanol and electricity
